# Playtime

Anti-procrastination through `hosts` file hackery.


## Installation

    $ gem install playtime


## Usage ##

    $ playtime setup      # => sets up default domain list in ~/.playtime
    $ playtime start      # => enables access to domain list
    $ playtime [stop]     # => disables access to domain list

You can modify your list of playtime-only domains in `~/.playtime`.  Just
use the root domain (`www.` will be added automatically.)
